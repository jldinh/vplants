    :Provides: **MTG** or *Multiscale Tree Graph* data structure.


In order to quickly learn how to read a MTG file and plot it with PlantGL, jump to the the :ref:`newmtg_quick_start`. If you are in a hurry and want to parse the MTG to retrieve information about it, look at the :ref:`newmtg_tutorial_mtg_aml` that fully describes the :mod:`openalea.mtg.aml` module. 

Then, we advice you to look at the section :ref:`newmtg_intro` to understand what is a MTG file through a detailled description of the format and a few examples (note that the section :ref:`newmtg_syntax` gives a full description of the format). The section :ref:`newmtg_illustration` explains through a full example what can be done with the MTG data in point of view of statistical analysis. 

Finally, once the MTG format is understood, you may want to create your own MTG file from scratch as described in Section :ref:`newmtg_tutorial`. 

.. note:: The full guide reference is also available :ref:`newmtg_reference`.
