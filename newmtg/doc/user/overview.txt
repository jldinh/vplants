**Openalea.Mtg** defines a Multiscale Tree Graph data structure or **MTG** for short.

This data structure is compatible with the standard MTG format.
For compatibility reasons, all the AMAPmod interfaces have been implemented in this package.
However, this is a completly new implementation written in Python.

If you have any problems, please contact the author or send a mail on the openalea mailing list <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr>.
