L-systems were conceived as a mathematical framework for modeling growth of plants. 
L-Py is a simulation software that mixes L-systems construction with the Python high-level modeling language. 
In addition to this software module, an integrated visual development environment has been developed that facilitates the creation of plant models.
In particular, easy to use optimization tools have been integrated. 
Thanks to Python and its modular approach, this framework makes it possible to integrate a variety of tools defined in different modeling context,
in particular tools from the OpenAlea platform. Additionally, it can be integrated as a simple growth simulation module 
into more complex computational pipelines.

L-Py is inspired by Lstudio/cpfg-lpfg defined by P. Prusinkiewicz et al. (http://algorithmicbotany.org/lstudio).
