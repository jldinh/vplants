This reference manual details functions, modules, and objects included in 
VPlants.Plantgl, describing what they are and what they do. For learning
how to use VPlants.Plantgl see :ref:`PlantGL_reference`.

   This "Reference Guide" is still very much work in progress; the material
   is not organized, and many aspects of VPlants.Plantgl are not 
   covered.

   More documentation can be found on the
   `openalea <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr>`__ wiki.
