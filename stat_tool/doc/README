To generate sphinx documentation:

    1. go to root directory of this package
    2. type "python setup.py build_sphinx"
    3. type "python setup.py build_sphinx -b latex"
    !! right now (April 2009), there is an issue in pshinx related to utf-8. Because we are using unicode, we need
    2.type "python setup.py build_sphinx"
    to fix manually the latex documents, switching from ut88 to utf8x in the preamble section.


to generate the epydoc documentation:

    epydoc --html -o stat_tool ../src/openalea/stat_tool/
