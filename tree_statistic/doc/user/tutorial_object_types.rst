Object types
============

There are several types of object in the the tree_statistic module.
A full description of each of them is available in the
:ref:`Reference Guide <tree_statistic_reference>`.

In this tutorial we will show how to use some of them (
:class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.trees.Tree`, 
:class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.trees.Trees`, and
:class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.hmt.HiddenMarkovIndOutTree`), together with their methods.

The :class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.trees.Tree` and
:class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.trees.Trees` objects are data structure,
used for the representation of forest and trees with mutliple attributes
(or variables) attached to their vertices.

In constrast, the :class:`~openalea.tree_statistic.hmt.HiddenMarkovIndOutTree`
objects correspond to statistical models for the analysis of tree-structured
data (or forest).
