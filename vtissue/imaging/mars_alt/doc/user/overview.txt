Mars Alt is a pipeline primarly designed to track cell lineages at different time steps.
It is the result of `Romain Fernandez' PhD <http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/Publications/Gregoire.Malandain/fernandez-phd-2010.pdf>`_.

The original version was based on shell scripts calling binaries, and using the chain needed a high level of computer
knowledge.

To make the Mars Alt pipeline usable for researchers outside the VirtualPlants team, an effort has been made to
port the original code to the Openalea Platform and diffuse the tools as part of the VPlants.VTissue package, freely.
The new version is now Python based, with dependencies to Numpy, Scipy and VPlants.Tissue, Openalea and binaries
contrinuted by the INRIA Asclepios team as well as binaries from the original version.

New developments and improvements will happen in this new version as it is a lot easier to use - in our opinion - than
the original one.

The VirtualPlant team and friends.
