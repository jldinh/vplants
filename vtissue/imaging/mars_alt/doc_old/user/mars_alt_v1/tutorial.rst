The tutorials were written with a purpose to provide step by step how to use all the basic functionalities of MARS-ALT. 

As MARS-ALT is currently based on Linux environment, the tutorials are mainly a guide through some basic bash scripts.

Through the tutorials, some bash scripts call binairies which are available with MIPS.

A quick guide through MARS showing the basic steps to 3-D reconstruction and segmentation of volumetric images

`Building MARS environment and Converting <building_mars.html>`_ : Generating groups of shell scripts and work folders in order to get starting with MARS and converting of input data (series of 2-D image files) into an optimized 3-D image format named inrimage.

`User-guided linear registration <floral_user_registration.html>`_ : Registration of images based on manually identification.

`Automated linear registration <linear_registration.html>`_ : Rigid registration computed from mapping between blocks.

`Automated non-linear registration <no_linear_registration.html>`_ : Registration computed from block-based pyramidal algorithm.

`Fusion <fusion.html>`_ : Iterative Fusion.

`Segmentation <segmentation.html>`_ : Automated cell segmentation.

`Using of TIFF images <convert_tiff.html>`_ : Converting TIFF images into InrImage.
